# Javascript Technical-Documentation-Page

A simple Javascript technical documentation page made using HTML/CSS/JS. This is a challenge from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

Also decided to try and implement the BEM naming convention. Still not completely about the best practices when using it, will continue to research and practice using it.
